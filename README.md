# ExpressionDetectionDemo
A simple example with the Facial Expression Recognition library for Python: https://pypi.org/project/fer/

### What does this example do?
The Python script detects your expression with FER and sends an according color to the Arduino. This was just a idea that I wanted to do and here it is, it doesn't have any real use, but I thought that this would be kinda cool for changing the lighting color for example when streaming to 'emphasize' the atmosphere.
